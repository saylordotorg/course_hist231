**Unit 1: Pre-Islamic Peoples and Civilizations of the Middle East and
Southeast Asia** <span id="1"></span> 
*The Middle East is a truly ancient and complex region.  The oldest
civilizations in recorded history originated in the Middle East and
Southwest Asia in roughly the fourth millennium BCE.  By the first
millennium BCE, major centers of urban civilization had developed in
modern-day Iraq, Iran, Syria, and Egypt.  Warfare and trade competition
between these competing urban centers shaped the economic and social
growth of the region.  Outside factors, including Greek and Roman
invasions at the end of the first millennium BCE, also had a powerful
influence on the development of the region.   In this unit, you will
examine the history of the peoples and civilizations of the Middle East
and Southwest Asia prior to the rise of Islam in the 7<sup>th</sup>
century CE.  You will look at how political, social, and cultural
influences from both the East and the West led to the development of
complex and diverse societies throughout the region and influenced the
growth and expansion of new empires at the beginning of the first
millennium CE.*
