**Unit 5: The Middle East and Southwest Asia in the Middle Ages** <span
id="5"></span> 
*Outside forces began to destabilize the expansive Abbasid Empire by the
beginning of the second millennium CE.  In 1063, Pope Alexander II gave
his papal blessing to Christian efforts to drive Abbasid conquerors out
of Spain.  Then, in response to pleas for aid from the head of the
Christian Byzantine Empire, Pope Gregory VII began promoting a holy war
against Muslims who had taken control of Jerusalem and the Holy Land in
1095.  Over the next two centuries, the Crusades brought Christians and
Muslims into direct military conflict over control of the Middle East
and Eastern Mediterranean.  In the East, the Abbasids faced a growing
threat from Mongol invaders.  In 1258, the Mongols sacked Baghdad and
killed the Abbasid caliph.  As a result, central rule in the Abbasid
Empire collapsed and political power shifted to new regional bases in
Egypt and Turkey.  In this unit, you will examine how European and
Mongol invaders destabilized the Abbasid Empire during the Middle Ages. 
You will also look at how the Christian Byzantine Empire (the remnant of
the once-vast Roman Empire) attempted to maintain its independence and
exert political control over Asia Minor despite threats from Muslim and
Western European foes. *
