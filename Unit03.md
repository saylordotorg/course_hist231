**Unit 3: The Umayyad and Abbasid Empires** <span id="3"></span> 
*After the period called “Rightly Guided Caliphs,” the Umayyad Caliphate
emerged in the mid-600s CE following a succession struggle among the
descendants of Muhammad.  In less than 50 years, the Umayyad Dynasty’s
military forces secured political control of a vast region stretching
from the Punjab region of India westward across the Middle East and
North Africa to Spain.  Umayyad leaders eventually moved their seat of
power from Arabia to Damascus (in modern-day Syria).  The Umayyads did
not force conquered peoples to convert to Islam, but they did tax
non-Muslim peoples heavily to provide revenues for the state.  In the
mid-700s, growing discontent with Umayyad rule led to a revolt that
brought the Abbasid family to power.  The Abbasid Dynasty shifted
political power from Damascus to Baghdad and attempted to develop
bureaucratic institutions to consolidate and manage their vast empire. 
In this unit, you will study the formation of the Umayyad Empire and its
impact on the peoples and cultures of the Middle East and Southwest
Asia.  You will also look at the differences between Umayyad and the
Abbasid imperial administrations and the major challenges that both
dynasties faced as they attempted to govern a vast and complex
political-religious empire.*
