**Unit 6: The Ottoman Empire** <span id="6"></span> 
*The collapse of the Abbasid Empire at the end of the 13<sup>th</sup>
century enabled Turkish rulers in eastern Asia Minor to consolidate
political power in the region.  Over the course of the 14<sup>th</sup>
and 15<sup>th</sup> centuries, Ottoman Turks chipped away at the
Byzantine Empire and established control over territories in the
Balkans.  In 1453, the Ottomans captured the Byzantine capitol of
Constantinople and the Turkish sultanate quickly emerged as a major
world power.  The Ottoman Empire continued to expand into Eastern Europe
and the Mediterranean Basin during the 1500s, but gradually became
overextended in the East and the West.  During the next three centuries,
the Ottomans attempted to consolidate their far-flung political and
military holdings while dealing with new threats along the periphery of
their empire.  During this time period, the Empire also entered a period
of economic and cultural decline, and, by the mid-19<sup>th</sup>
century, it had lost much of the economic and political power it had
once possessed.  Nationalist movements threatened the integrity of the
Empire and the Ottomans became dependent on Western European banks for
funding to finance modernization projects.  Consequently, the Empire was
no longer in a position to resist encroachments by imperialist European
powers. *  
 *In this unit, you will look at the rapid expansion and gradual decline
of the Ottoman Empire from the 1300s through the end of the
19<sup>th</sup> century.  You will examine the administrative structure
of the Ottoman state and consider why central authorities failed to
implement important social, cultural, and economic reforms in the
18<sup>th</sup> and 19<sup>th</sup> centuries.  Finally, you will
examine how European nations began to undercut the economic and
political power of the Empire at the beginning of the 19<sup>th</sup>
century.*

    letter (circa 1550) by an unknown Genoese traveler.  It vividly
    describes a portion of a daily life in the women’s section of the
