This course will introduce you to the history of the Middle East and

You will learn about the major political, economic, and social changes

illustrate important overarching political, economic, and social themes,
such as the formation of ancient empires in the second and first
millennia BCE, the political and social influence of Islam on the region
in the first millennium CE, the growth and expansion of Muslim states in
the second millennium CE, and the impact of European imperialism on the
region in the 18<sup>th</sup> and 19<sup>th</sup> centuries.  By the end

Asia developed politically, economically, and socially prior to World
War One and recognize the critical role that the region played in the
broader development of European and Asian societies.

**Requirements for Completion:** In order to complete this course, you
will need to work through each unit and all of its assigned materials. 
Pay special attention to Unit 1 as this lays the groundwork for
understanding the more advanced, exploratory material presented in later
units.  You will also need to complete:  

-   Final Exam

Note that you will only receive an official grade on your Final Exam. 
However, in order to adequately prepare for this exam, you will need to
work through the readings, lectures, and web media in each unit.  
    
 In order to “pass” this course, you will need to earn a 70% or higher
on the Final Exam.  Your score on the exam will be tabulated as soon as
you complete it.  If you do not pass the exam, you may take it again.  
    
 **Time Commitment**: This course should take you a total of
**130.25 hours** to complete.  Each unit includes a “time advisory” that
lists the amount of time you are expected to spend on each subunit. 
These should help you plan your time accordingly.  It may be useful to
take a look at these time advisories and to determine how much time you
have over the next few weeks to complete each unit, and then to set
goals for yourself.  For example, Unit 1 should take you 10 hours. 
Perhaps you can sit down with your calendar and decide to complete the
subunit 1.1 introduction through Subunit s 1.1.3 (a total of 3 hours) on
Monday night; Subunit s 1.1.4 through 1.1.8 (a total of 3 hours) on
Tuesday; subunits 1.2 and 1.3 (a total of 4 hours) on Wednesday night;
etc.
