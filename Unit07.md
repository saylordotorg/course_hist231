**Unit 7: Persia Under the Safavid Empire and Beyond** <span
id="7"></span> 
*The Shi’a Safavid Empire presented a major threat to the Sunni Ottoman
Empire.  The two empires vied for power especially in Mesopotamia. 
Although both were Islamic empires, they were political rivals and
economic competitors.  The Safavids established the Twelver school of
Shi'a Islam as the official religion of their empire.  Soon after its
formation, this Shi’a empire cultivated trade and political relations
with the Western powers, especially with Great Britain.  These relations
mark the beginnings of European intervention in Iran.*  
 *             
 In this unit, you will learn about the political, artistic, and
cultural accomplishments of this empire and its relations with the
neighboring Ottoman Empire.  In addition to two major dynasties—the
Safavids and the Qajars— that ruled Persia between the 16<sup>th</sup>
to the 20<sup>th</sup> centuries, you will learn about the European
involvement in the region.  *
