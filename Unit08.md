**Unit 8: European Imperialism and the Middle East** <span
id="8"></span> 
*By the beginning of the 19<sup>th</sup> century, European imperialist
states began to play a direct role in the political affairs and economic
development of the Middle East and Southwest Asia.  Napoleon invaded
Egypt in 1798, but British and Ottoman troops drove French forces out
three years later.  Anarchy followed until Muhammad Ali took control of
the Egyptian government.  Once in power, Ali expanded Egyptian control
of the region and challenged the power of the Ottoman regime.  He and
his descendants also engaged in a modernization campaign in Egypt with
the assistance of European powers.  Egypt fell into debt to French and
British investors, who gained effective control of the government. 
Elsewhere in the region, Russian forces challenged Ottoman control of
the Caucasus region and forced the Ottomans to open the Black Sea to
international shipping.  Russian and British forces also challenged
Iranian control of the Caspian Sea region and forced concessions from
the Iranian government.  By the late 19<sup>th</sup> century, the
Ottoman Empire had lost political control over many of its territories
outside Asia Minor.  Internal modernization and developments efforts
funded by European investors had put the Empire in debt to European
nations and reduced its political independence.  In the early 1900s, the
Empire became increasingly unstable as political movements challenged
the power of the sultan inside Turkey.  In this unit, you will examine
how European imperialism altered Middle Eastern politics, economic
affairs, and social life during the 19<sup>th</sup> and early
20<sup>th</sup> centuries.  You will also evaluate how European nations
gained de facto control over many of the states of the region and how
they used this power to enrich European investors.  Finally, you will
look at how Ottoman alliances with Germany and Austria-Hungary in World
War I led to the downfall of the Empire following the conflict.  *
