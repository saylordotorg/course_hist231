**Unit 4: The Social and Cultural Impact of Islam** <span
id="4"></span> 
*Islam had a powerful social and cultural impact on the Middle East and
Southwest Asia.  It served as an overarching social and cultural
institution uniting the diverse peoples of the regions conquered by
Muslim rulers beginning in the mid-600s CE.  Islam promoted strict
religious and ethical values and offered specific guidelines for
behavioral and social norms.  It also promoted the unity of religious
and political institutions.  With the assent of the Abbasid Dynasty in
the mid-700s, the Middle East entered the Islamic Golden Age.  Over the
next 400 years, Muslim scholars and scientists made significant advances
in agricultural production, applied mathematics, chemistry, and other
fields.  As Islamic cities grew more crowded, water and sewer systems
were added and other means were used to promote cleanliness and public
health.  In this unit, you will examine the social and cultural impact
of Islam on the regions conquered by Muslim rulers during the last three
centuries of the first millennium CE and take a look at the scientific
and humanistic advances of the Islamic Golden Age.  *
