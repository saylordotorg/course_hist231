**Unit 2: Islam and the Emergence of the Muslim State** <span
id="2"></span> 
*The emergence of Islam in Arabia during the 7<sup>th</sup> century CE
had a significant social and political impact on the development of the
Middle East and Southwest Asia.  Muhammad, the founder of the Muslim
faith, began preaching to his fellow tribesmen in Mecca and later Medina
in the early 600s.  By the time of his death in 632, he had united the
warring tribes of the Arabian Peninsula into a single religious and
political community.  Later caliphs (religious successors to Muhammad)
conquered surrounding kingdoms and rapidly spread Islam throughout
Southwest Asia and the Mediterranean Basin.  In this unit, you will
examine the origins of Islam and look at its broader political and
social influence on the region.  You will also explore how Islam evolved
from a regional religious faith into a powerful socio-political force
that had a lasting impact on the peoples and cultures of the Middle East
and Southwest Asia.*
